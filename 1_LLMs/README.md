## What is a Large Language Model?
At a high level, a Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI system designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. It is trained on vast amounts of text data and uses statistical patterns in that data to predict the most likely words, sentences, or responses.


## Key ideas in simple terms
- Learns patterns from text, not facts directly.
- Predicts the next word, and from that capability can write paragraphs, answer questions, code, summarize, and more.
- Understands context well enough to follow instructions, hold conversations, and solve problems that involve language.
- Doesn’t think or know, but it models language so well that it appears to.


## How it works

Input Text

[Tokenization & Embedding]

Numerical Representations

[Deep Neural Networks]
(Transformer Architecture)

```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Input**: Text is received
2. **Tokenization**: Text is converted to numerical representations (tokens/embeddings)
3. **Processing**: Deep neural networks (often "transformer" architecture) process the numerical data
4. **Output**: The model generates the most likely continuation (words, sentences, etc.) - Tokens, actually
